### Hi, I'm Carrington (Rain) 👋

I'm a software engineer at [Acquia](https://acquia.com) with a passion for front-end development
whether it's building stunning UI components or improving accessibility and user experience. 
Developer experience is another key interest of mine, as I strive to empower myself and other engineers 
to build excellent solutions with less friction. TypeScript, React, CSS, and Java are where you'll find 
me the happiest, and a little Python thrown in for good measure.

Outside of work, I'm an Arizona native who loves city life almost as much as I like snow in the winter. 
In my free time, I spend quality moments with my wife and dog, "Beanz." I’m a fan of video games and anything 
sports-related.  I also make it a point to travel as often as I can, hoping to see as much of the world as possible. 
My recent adventures have taken me to Tokyo, Japan; Maui, Hawaii; and Sinaloa, Mexico. Europe is next! 

## 🔭 Recent projects

- [TicTacToe](https://github.com/CarringtonAllison/tictactoe). A simple React app that
  allows you to play tic tac toe. Just a fun way to learn some new technologies. 

## 🌱 I’m currently learning

- [React 19](https://react.dev/). Been reading through the docs for many of
  the React canary features understanding how they can be used in the
  future.
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). Interested in some of the features Next.js offers including
  faster performance through server-side rendering and static site generation. Navigation and
  backend functionality should be simplified with file-based routing and API routes.
  I plan to have most side projects started in Next.js going forward. 
- Advanced CSS features. Now using [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) as my main framework. Nothing super specific, but
  just been doing a lot more with advanced CSS features like scroll-driven animations, anchor positioning, and lots more.

## ⚡ Fun facts

- The first programming language I learned was Ruby which I rarely
  use anymore. ♦️  
- I've had many hobbies over the years including cinematography🎥,
  mud runs🏃‍♂️, performing music, and more. 🏅🏀🏈
- I play the Trumpet daily. 🎺
