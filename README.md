### Hi, I'm Carrington (Rain) 👋

I'm a software engineer at [Acquia](https://acquia.com) with a passion for front-end development
whether it's building stunning UI components or improving accessibility and user experience. 
Developer experience is another key interest of mine, as I strive to empower myself and other engineers 
to build excellent solutions with less friction. TypeScript, React, CSS, and Java are where you'll find 
me the happiest, and a little Python thrown in for good measure.

Outside of work, I'm an Arizona native who loves city life almost as much as I like snow in the winter. 
In my free time, I spend quality moments with my wife and dog, "Beanz." I’m a fan of video games and anything 
sports-related.  I also make it a point to travel as often as I can, hoping to see as much of the world as possible. 
My recent adventures have taken me to Tokyo, Japan; Maui, Hawaii; and Sinaloa, Mexico. Europe is next! 

## 🔭 Recent projects

- [Find Your Dog](https://github.com/CarringtonAllison/FindYourDog). A web application designed to allow users to search for dogs based on various filters such as breed, age, and location. It features user authentication, the ability to mark favorite dogs, and functionality to find a match based on user preferences. The app also supports pagination and sorting of search results.

- [TicTacToe](https://github.com/CarringtonAllison/tictactoe). The "Tic Tac Toe" project is a simple web-based game built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. It uses Tailwind CSS for styling and ESLint for code linting. The game allows two players to choose X or O, take turns making moves, and automatically detect if there's a winner or a draw. Players can restart the game once it's over.

## 🌱 I’m currently learning

- [React 19](https://react.dev/). I have been reading through the docs for many of
  the React canary features understanding how they can be used in the
  future.
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). Interested in some of the features Next.js offers including
  faster performance through server-side rendering and static site generation. Navigation and
  backend functionality should be simplified with file-based routing and API routes.
  I plan to have most side projects started in Next.js going forward. 
- Advanced CSS features. Now using [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) as my main framework. Nothing super specific, but
  just been doing a lot more with advanced CSS features like scroll-driven animations, anchor positioning, and lots more.

## ⚡ Fun facts

- The first programming language I learned was Ruby which I rarely
  use anymore. ♦️  
- I've had many hobbies over the years including cinematography🎥,
  mud runs🏃‍♂️, performing music, and more. 🏅🏀🏈
- I play the Trumpet daily. 🎺
